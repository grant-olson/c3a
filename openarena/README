==OPENARENA Readme -	 10/31/2008==

Thank you for downloading OpenArena!

===SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS===

* Pentium II 233MHz / AMD K6-2 300MHz or equally powerful processor
* 64MB of system memory
* OpenGL supported video card with 16MB of video memory. (Voodoo Banshee, TNT and up)
* 300MB of hard drive space

We recommend a 700MHz Pentium III / Athlon with a Geforce2 64mb. 

===User Data===

	Screenshots, configurations, and demos that are produced are in a local data directory rather than the game's own directory, if it is supported by the OS.

Where you'll probably find it-
	Windows 98/ME:
		C:\Windows\AppData\OpenArena\
	Windows NT/2000/XP:
		C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Application Data\OpenArena\
	Linux:
		/home/username/.openarena/
	Mac OS X:

===Legacy Client===

	By popular demand (popular = 1 person :( ), starting with OA 0.8.1 now ships with a new client based off the older 0.7.1 version.  Due to it being based on an old version (from before the whole ioq3 SDL fiasco) it is not officially supported by the OpenArena team.  Your mileage may vary.

	To use this, copy the client from the 'legacy' directory to the upper level, and start it.  For compatibility, please don't delete the other. This is only an alternative if you prefer the 'old style' pre-SDL input and video performance.

===Source===
Source for content is available at http://openarena.ws/svn/source/
The engine source is also there as well as the VMs source.

==FAQ==
===There's some missing textures===
Yeah :(

===I WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS YOU OWE ME MONEY.===
$0 budget, spare time, and less than 6 active contributors kinda make things hard :)

===I can only be Kyonshi and Sergei in Missionpack! What gives!===
James and Janet aren't modeled yet, so for the gameplay code to even function we have to depend on these two player models.

===YOU STOLE THOSE QUAKE MAPS!!! IM TELLING ID SOFTWARE YOUR IN BIG TORUBLE MISTER.===
John Romero released them under the GNU GPL v2, and since they're timeless deathmatch classics we couldn't resist porting a few of them over. If you're going to pull a [citation needed], here's a URL for you:

Be sure to check the license in the ZIP file.  Oh by the way, this isn't what I would call "content scavenging", since the license here allows modification and sharing of the changes and source.

===BUT THIS IS SCAVENGED CRAP!!!! YOUR A UNTALENTED HACK===
...

===Where did q3dm6ish-v2 and schism go?===
In early October it was confirmed by cgtextures.com that their textures were not Free so the maps currently using the offending textures are removed.

===Where did q3dm6ish go?===
Oh no it's gone off the list due to quality reasons!!! Sorry :(

===Where did void4 go?===
Textures mysteriously broke :\ it's also a bad level

===Where did Ayumi\Neko go?===
Her skin sucked, and Ayumi is going through a change into a new mesh so this skin would be abandoned in advance. Plus neko looks better on angelyss anyway :)

===Where did Ayumi\Jenna go?===
In this version, to save space and gain more FPS we had to delete the 'body' out of Ayumi's torso and merge the remainder with the shirt. Unfortunately this broke the Jenna skin and as such we have to remove it. :(
Ayumi still doesn't look good, and needs a remake from scratch anyway.

===This game is a big crap! Everything is not consistent!! its to wacky and fruty!!!===
Well, the original game is also as equally as inconsistent and wacky (and due to this we are free to have so much creative variety in this one), we're just not paid hundred-thousands to work on it to make it 'look good'.

===I don't like Angelyss and Arachna! Too much!!!===
You can remove pak2-players-mature.pk3 from your baseoa directory. Be warned though, you won't be able to join pure servers without using this pk3 file.
