TODO List

- Weapons are jpegs, not tiffs.  Need to be able to read those files.
- OpenGL is cross-cutting the logic.  Can I break the GL out into GL only files?
- Smart clipping.
- More camera angles during move.
- extract_piece_from_list should take location, not coordinates
- Acutally read animation config files for models instead of hardcoding.
