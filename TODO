TODO List

- Do clipping right with my own matrix math.
- OpenGL is cross-cutting the logic.  Can I break the GL out into GL only files?  Pencil and Camera might take care of that.
- extract_piece_from_list should take location, not coordinates
- Acutally read animation config files for models instead of hardcoding.
