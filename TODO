TODO List

- UPDATE COPYRIGHT
- FIGURE OUT DIST ISSUES ON OPENARENA STUFF
- UPDATE README
- UPDATE TEXT on --version

- OpenGL is cross-cutting the logic.  Can I break the GL out into GL only files?
- Smart clipping.
- More camera angles during move.
- extract_piece_from_list should take location, not coordinates
- Acutally read animation config files for models instead of hardcoding.
