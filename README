CHESS III ARENA
===============

Chess III Arena is a simple chess game that utilizes the Quake III
Arena characters.  It was written as my first (allegedly) non- trivial
ocaml application so I could see what I thought about the language.
But more about that later.  Most normal people are probably just
interested in playing the game.

------------ 
Installation
------------ 

Windows
=======

  - Download the executable in zip format.

  - Extract the files.  [Right- click, choose Extract All, Next your
    way through the wizard.]

  - Either:
  
      + Insert your Quake 3 CD and open it via Windows
        Explorer. [Right click on Drive letter and choose explore.]

      - Navigate to the installation directory if Quake 3 is aready
        installed.

  - Navigate to the Quake3/baseq3 directory.

  - Copy the file pak0.pk3 to the c3a directory created when you
    extracted c3a.  Note: If you are copying from a local install, you
    must copy and paste the file. [Right- Click copy, Right- Click
    paste in the destination directory.]  If you drag- and- drop, it
    will move the file and break your Quake 3 install.

  - Rename the file pak0.pk3 to pak0.zip.  [Right- click, select rename]

  - Extract the contents.  [Right- click, choose Extract All.  Next
    your way through the wizard

  - Verify that the files are in the right place.  From the c3a
    directory, you should be able to navigate to the following
    directory: pak0/models/players

  - Double-click on c3a.exe and enjoy!

Linux
=====

Note: Although the program should run on any OpenGL implementation,
you're really going to need some sort of hardware acceleration for
reasonable rendering performance.

    - Install OCaml 3.09 or greater and the accompanying LablGL
      library, however that is done on your distro.

    - Grab the source .tgz, extract it somewhere.

    - Within the new c3a directory, create a subdirectory called pak0

    - Locate the file pak0.pk3 from either your Quake 3 installation
      or the Quake 3 CD.  It is located under the subdirectory
      Quake3/baseq3 on the CD

    - Rename the file to pak0.pk3 [mv pak0.pak pak0.zip]

    - Unzip the contents. [unzip pak0.zip]

    - Verify that the files are in the right place.  From the c3a
      directory, you should be able to navigate to the following
      directory: pak0/models/players

    - Go back to the original c3a directory.

    - run ./make_native.sh

    - Right now there is no 'install', you run out of the working directory

    - Run ./c3a.exe and enjoy!

Building on Windows
===================

I'm compiling on the MSVC version of Ocaml.  In addition to the base
install, you'll need to install LablGL and flexdll.  If everything is
working, you should be able to run make_native.bat from the source
directory.

----------------
Playing the Game
----------------

Simply double-click on the file c3a.exe in windows, or run ./c3a on
linux.

When you run the game, you should initially see a title screen.  Click
anywhere on the screen to start the game.  You will see an overhead
view of the board.  Blue is "white" and Red is "black", so Blue goes
first.  Click on the piece you want to move.  Click on where you want
to move it.  If you want to change pieces (that is, you haven't 'taken
your hand off the piece yet') simply click on a square that is in
invalid move location, such as the piece itself.  Repeat for red.
Repeat until someone checkmates.

Chess III Arena will act as a front end to gnuchess.  If you have
gnuchess installed, simply start with the command:

c3a -red gnuchess

to have the computer play red with you going first, or:

c3a -white gnuchess

to have the computer start first.
